In July, I traveled to the mountains with my friends. We went to Cusco and spent a week exploring the city and its surroundings. We visited the Sacred Valley, hiked to Machu Picchu, and tried traditional dishes like cuy chactado and lomo saltado. One night, we joined a local festival, danced to Andean music, and enjoyed the colorful costumes. It was an unforgettable and exciting adventure.

Next summer, I’m going to visit Arequipa. I want to go during the Anniversary celebrations in August. I’m going to explore the Colca Canyon, see the flight of the condors, and walk around the Plaza de Armas. I would like to taste rocoto relleno, meet friendly locals, and learn more about the history of the White City. It’s a place I’ve wanted to visit for years.

In January, I traveled to the north with my family. We went to Trujillo and spent five days exploring the city and its beautiful beaches. We visited the Chan Chan archaeological site, walked through the colonial streets, and enjoyed shows of the traditional marinera dance. One afternoon, we relaxed at Huanchaco Beach, watched the fishermen on their caballitos de totora, and tasted delicious ceviche. It was a warm and joyful trip.

Next year, I’m going to visit Piura. I want to go during the Señor Cautivo de Ayabaca festivities in October. I’m going to explore Catacaos, buy local handicrafts, and try seco de chabelo and tamales verdes. I would like to meet new people, enjoy the music and dances, and learn more about the traditions of the region. It’s a trip I’ve been dreaming about for a long time.
